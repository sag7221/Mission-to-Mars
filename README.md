#### What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)?
Coldest ( lowest temperature) , month: 3
Warmest temp: Month: 8

#### Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars?
Lowest pressure is MONTH 6
Highest pressure is MONTH 9

#### How many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year? That is, in the time that Mars circles the Sun once, how many days elapse on Earth?
From the plot created: "Martian_temperatures.jpeg", If you look at temperature peak 2013-01, the next temperature peak occurs around 2014-11, which is around 23 months in a year in Mars. So around 23 X 30 (days) = 690 terrestrial days in a Martian year
